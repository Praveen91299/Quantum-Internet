    "## Establishing entanglement [4]  \n",
    "of the various processes suggested, we look at the following methods. Quantum information can be transmitted via optical channels. With distance of transmission, the sent information is corrupted by interactions with environment and other factors and hence it's fidelity reduces with increasing distance. So, to recover the entanglement pair, we can send multiple inputs and combine them to fewer entanglement pair by a process called distillation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the catch, for distillation to be successful and feasible, the fidelity is required to be greater that 0.5 (depends on procedure used). So the length the channel the qubit can travel is restricted by an upper bound before it can never be recovered again. To overcome this, we place repeaters at intermediate points. So successive repeaters can exchange e-bits and perform entanglement swapping operations after distillation to establish long range entanglement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Though yet again, there's another catch. The measurements and processes performed by the repeaters may not be perfect and will reduce the fidelity of the pair. So all this errors accumulate, and if enough error such that fidelity drops below 0.5, the long range entanglement pair cannot be successfully distilled out. Thus at every, say m repeaters we are required to perform distillation after swapping and then proceed to the next iteration of this procedure. See the diagram below:  \n",

    "### Modelling a phase insensitive Gaussian Bosonic channel  \n",
    "\n",
    "Optical fibres similar to those currently used in the classical internet system can be used to transmit quantum states, via photons, which are bosonic in nature. We can represent bosonic states by the fock number representation $|n\\rangle$ where n denotes the number of photons and not the state of the photon. These are similar to the modes of the Quantum Harmonic oscillator.  \n",

    "For QKD systems and any quantum transmission systems, we can model it in two ways, using single photon states and it's state and polarisation determining the state. This requires single photon sources that may not be readily available. The photon output can be modelled by a poissonic distribution and in the case of multiple photons simultaneously emmited, we can show that QKD is not computationally secure and eve can just use a beam splitter and retain one of the photons. Though one can design protocols that are computationally secure (Refer Renato Renner's thesis), we can show that for realistic quantum networks where there are high loses and single photon sources are both hard to create and the single photon has a very low probability of successfully making it to the receiver in a coherent fashion. We use Gaussian states over mulitple modes and $>1$ average number of photons to model transmission and is detailed below. We can also show that since optical channels are gaussian, best rates are achieved using gaussian states [3].  "

In a standard teleportation protocol, Alice performs some unitary followed by measurements on his state and his space of the EPR and transmit's classical information to Bob to receive the message state. One can show that this simulation of channels is possible when the resource state is chosen to be the choi representation of the channel, $\\sigma = (I \\otimes \\mathcal{E})(\\Phi)$ where $\\Phi$ is the maximally entangled EPR state.
